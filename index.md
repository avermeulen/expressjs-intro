# Express

Express is a small unopinionated web server for NodeJS.

By default it can't do much, one needs to add middleware enable functionality.
We will add:

 * HTTP Sessions;
 * Form variables;
 * Flash messages to Express.

 There are lots other things you can add to Express, once you know the basics.
