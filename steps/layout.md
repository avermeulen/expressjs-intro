## Layout & CSS frameworks

How do you make your Spaza Shop reports looking nice on laptops, tablets and phones? Responsive Web Design is the answer. If a web site is responsive it will respond correctly to the device that it is displayed on. Responsive web design is a whole field in it's own right. Luckily there are some frameworks you can build on. These frameworks are:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
* [Comparing CSS frameworks](http://responsive.vermilion.com/compare.php)
